## 📊 Project Overview

This project was completed as part of my Business Intelligence Analyst bootcamp at TripleTen.  
The goal was to explore Zomato’s customer base, segment users based on their spending behavior, and uncover actionable insights that can guide marketing, retention, and revenue growth strategies.  
The analysis leverages data cleaning, aggregation, visualization, and storytelling techniques — resulting in an interactive dashboard that visualizes key customer patterns and business opportunities.

## 🧪 Analysis Approach

The analysis followed a structured BI workflow:

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
   - Removed invalid transactions and filtered to INR currency.  
   - Joined and aggregated data from multiple tables (`orders`, `users`, `menu`, etc.).  

2. **Customer Segmentation**  
   - Grouped users into Low, Medium, and High-value segments based on total revenue.  
   - Calculated KPIs: total orders, average order value, revenue per customer, and activity duration.

3. **Time-Series Analysis**  
   - Tracked orders and revenue over time for each segment.  
   - Identified seasonal spikes, behavioral trends, and engagement patterns.

4. **Visualization & Storytelling**  
   - Built an interactive Tableau dashboard showing segmentation, revenue contribution, and time-based trends.  
   - Provided actionable insights and recommendations to guide Zomato’s customer strategy.
